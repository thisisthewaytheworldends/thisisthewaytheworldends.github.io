His sizeable reputation as both an artist and a game designer become apparent as soon as one hits the play button. From the beginning, it is blatantly obvious how much thought Mak has put into the design of his game. To the untrained eye (and ear!), the game play runs almost unnoticably smooth, and the game engages the player and keeps them engaged with its shifting guitar music, and bright colors. The very deliberate way that Mak incorporated his guitar music into Everyday Shooter excites players, and makes them curious to try new things.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surprisingly, Mak’s choice in music stayed clear and simplistic throughout all of his levels rather than changing with each level. Mak’s deliberate use of only guitar sounds kept the background uncluttered and original. He uses guitar riffs as the background music which, is notable due to the electric guitar not usually being an instrument that plays without accompaniment.  The repetitive riffs are quite the change in pace from the expected fast multi-part rythm based background music that other games of this nature tend to have. This stark difference makes Everyday Shooter stand out musically. Another interesting fact was that Mak himself did the soundtrack. His channeled his interest and skills as a guitarist into his game. It begs the question, did Mak create the game to highlight his guitar skills, or were his guitar skills just used as a platform in which to enhance his game idea?</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic gameplay of Everyday Shooter is (as referenced in the title) a shooter/bullet-hell style game. This particular genre is generally not hard to figure out in the early levels (literally shoot EVERYTHING), but definitely can ramp-up difficulty wise as the levels progress. While we know that the background stayed simple and intriguing, I think the most important musical aspect of Everyday Shooter is the sound effects. Every time an enemy is hit, a synth-guitar sound is played. In theory this might get lost in the guitar-riff-background-music, but in practice, it does something entirely different. In most of these shooter games, players are used to hearing the obvious correlation between enemy deaths and shooter sounds. Everyday Shooter does not fall into this stereotype. Instead, the synth sounds of the enemies being hit becomes a subconscious type of feedback. This type of feedback might not be obvious (or even noticed at all) for the first little while of gameplay. The player kills enemies, and their brain makes a subconscious connection between the extra note played in the guitar riff.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of the sound effect fading into the background like expected, the player slowly notices the change in the pattern of the guitar riff every time they hit an enemy. This actually brings the background music to the players attention, subtly highlighting the unique auditory choices that Mak made in the guitar-riff themed music. Everyday Shooter uses each portion of its audio to accentuate the others. Mak’s Everyday Shooter won its awards not just for having making elegant, yet simple music choices, but for its successful attempt in creating a unique sound that integrates the gameplay and the audio together to create a single cohesive piece.</p><p><br></p></blockquote></div>
